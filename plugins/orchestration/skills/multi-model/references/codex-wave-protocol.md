# Codex-native supervised wave protocol

Use this protocol only for a GPT-5.6-only wave. It is the host adapter for the
shared wave contract, mechanical verifier, supervisor verdict schema,
escalation ladder, and result review in `SKILL.md`; it does not redefine any of
them. Claude-only waves use `wave-runner.workflow.mjs` instead. A mixed or
unknown-provider wave stops before any agent is spawned.

All commands in this reference resolve from the multi-model skill base directory:
the sibling plan linter is `../super-plan/references/plan-lint.mjs`, and the
state helper is `references/codex-wave-state.mjs`. A lint-clean plan that the
user explicitly approved is authoritative for adapter execution: use its exact
provider, model, and effort fields; do not re-route or reject them against seed
profile recommendations. This does not permit mixed/unknown providers or bypass
lint and user approval.

The state helper is the only state machine. Never hand-edit its state, bypass a
helper action, write a fresh runner, force-remove a worktree, or substitute a
missing model with a default or alias. It accepts only the exact GPT model IDs
and effort values already linted in the plan.

## Commands and action loop

The helper has exactly these seven commands:

```text
init  next  record-executor  verify  supervisor-prompt  record-verdict  summary
```

1. Run the canonical plan linter first. Stop on every linter error; do not
   repair a plan by hand during a live wave.

   ```sh
   node ../super-plan/references/plan-lint.mjs <plan-file> --repo <repo>
   ```

2. Resolve the exact fork point from the pushed default-branch tip and push it
   before spawning. Copy the full SHA from `git rev-parse origin/<default-branch>`;
   never use a local-only `HEAD`. Initialize one wave state and retain the
   returned state path:

   ```sh
   node references/codex-wave-state.mjs init \
     --plan <plan-file> --wave <N> --repo <absolute-repo> --base <pushed-full-sha>
   ```

   `init` creates the exact returned worktrees and `wave/<task-id>` branches.
   A conflict is a stop: preserve the existing worktree, branch, and state.

3. Call `next --state <state-path>`. Perform exactly its one returned action.
   Do not infer a next action, synthesize a prompt, or advance a task yourself.
   Native coordination uses `spawn_agent`, `followup_task`, and `wait_agent`.
   Track every child handle with its role, exact model, and exact effort, plus
   whether that exact child remains available. Wait for a child’s final response
   with `wait_agent`. `followup_task` is allowed only when the new helper action
   has the same role, exact model, and exact effort and that exact child remains
   available; its message is the helper-returned prompt only. If no such child
   exists, or the model or effort changes, use a fresh `spawn_agent`. Never
   follow up an old child under a changed tuple.

   Every fresh spawn gets a collision-free `task_name` matching `[a-z0-9_]+`.
   Replace every hyphen in the helper's kebab-case task id with `_`, retain a
   monotonically increasing `spawn_id`, and form the name as
   `wave_<task_id>_<role>_<spawn_id>`.

4. For `spawn-executor`, use a matching available executor child only under the
   tuple rule above; otherwise spawn a new executor. The executor receives only
   the helper-returned `prompt` and works only in the exact returned `worktree`.
   Every new `spawn_agent` call explicitly passes the returned exact `model`
   and exact `effort` as `reasoning_effort`; a missing value stops the wave.

   ```js
   const task_id = action.task.replaceAll("-", "_")
   const spawn_id = ++spawnCounter
   await spawn_agent({
     task_name: `wave_${task_id}_executor_${spawn_id}`,
     fork_turns: "none",
     model: action.model,
     reasoning_effort: action.effort,
     message: action.prompt,
   })
   ```

   Record only the child’s final report, never hidden reasoning, tool traces,
   or an orchestrator paraphrase:

   ```sh
   printf '%s' '{"report":"<final report only>"}' | \
     node references/codex-wave-state.mjs record-executor \
       --state <state-path> --task <task-id>
   ```

5. For `verify`, run the helper’s mechanical verifier — do not ask a model to
   replace it:

   ```sh
   node references/codex-wave-state.mjs verify --state <state-path> --task <task-id>
   ```

   Then obtain the sole supervisor input from the helper:

   ```sh
   node references/codex-wave-state.mjs supervisor-prompt \
     --state <state-path> --task <task-id>
   ```

   The helper supplies the shared contract, verifier facts, redacted report,
   and existing supervisor prompt. Do not name or reveal executor identity in
   the supervisor prompt.

6. For `spawn-supervisor`, use the returned `model` and `effort`. It is the
   different exact model selected by `next`; never choose an alternative based
   on a label, availability guess, or default. The same tuple rule applies to
   supervisor retries: use `followup_task` only for the same role, exact model,
   and exact effort on an available supervisor child. On a changed model or
   effort, or no suitable live child, spawn a fresh supervisor. Pass the
   helper-returned supervisor prompt as its only task text, require its fixed
   verdict JSON, and pass that JSON unchanged to the recorder:

   ```js
   const task_id = action.task.replaceAll("-", "_")
   const spawn_id = ++spawnCounter
   await spawn_agent({
     task_name: `wave_${task_id}_supervisor_${spawn_id}`,
     fork_turns: "none",
     model: action.model,
     reasoning_effort: action.effort,
     message: supervisorPrompt.prompt,
   })
   ```

   ```sh
   printf '%s' '<fixed verdict JSON>' | node references/codex-wave-state.mjs \
     record-verdict --state <state-path> --task <task-id>
   ```

7. If a native agent or tool returns no result, has a transport failure, or is
   unavailable, record exactly one fixed payload at the applicable point:

   ```json
   {"error":{"kind":"null-result"}}
   ```

   ```json
   {"error":{"kind":"transport"}}
   ```

   ```json
   {"error":{"kind":"tool-unavailable"}}
   ```

   Send a fixed error to `record-executor` for an executor failure or
   `record-verdict` for a supervisor failure. Do not persist free-form
   transport output, request hidden reasoning, fabricate a report/verdict, or
   reinterpret an infrastructure failure as success.

8. After every recorder response, call `next` again and repeat exactly the
   returned action. `stop` preserves every state file and branch; return the
   helper summary, verdict history, and branch names to the user without retrying
   outside the helper.

9. On `merge-ready`, wait until the final wave result is merge-ready, then call
   `summary --state <state-path>`. Confirm every task is `ok`, merge all `ok`
   branches in plan/task order, and run the shared full-wave review. Branch
   final integration on multi-model's explicit publication contract, never on
   host or model. In normal `publication: push` mode, multi-model pushes and
   then derives the next wave’s exact base from the pushed branch and
   initializes its state with `init`, as before. In `publication: local` mode,
   merge only into the
   local feature branch, return its resulting local commit(s), task branch
   names, helper summary, and verdict evidence to the caller, and perform no
   push. Local mode does not derive or initialize a later wave from that
   unpushed base. If the approved fixes need dependent bases outside this one
   supervised wave, stop before publication. Do not merge early in a multi-task
   wave.

The action loop is intentionally narrow: helper state records reports, verifier
facts, and fixed verdicts only. It never stores credentials or hidden reasoning.
