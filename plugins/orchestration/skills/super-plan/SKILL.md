# Planning Waves (super-plan)

The dialogue and no-placeholders planning discipline here is adapted from
Jesse Vincent's superpowers (MIT — see `references/LICENSE-superpowers`);
the output format and every contract rule are this plugin's own.

## Step 0 — load exactly one active-seat profile

1. Read the `PLUGIN_RUNTIME_CONTEXT_V1` line for this plugin.
2. If it carries a supported exact model id, load that id's relative profile.
3. Otherwise use an exact model id explicitly supplied by the session.
4. Otherwise load the generic profile and treat both model and effort as unknown.

Never read a user config file to guess a session override. Never load more than one active-seat profile. A profile whose exact-id guard does not match must not be applied.

| Exact model id | Relative profile |
|---|---|
| `claude-fable-5-1` | `../multi-model/references/orchestrator-fable-5-1.md` |
| `claude-fable-5` | `../multi-model/references/orchestrator-fable-5.md` |
| `claude-opus-5` (any context-window suffix) | `../multi-model/references/orchestrator-opus-5.md` |
| `claude-opus-4-8` (any suffix) | `../multi-model/references/orchestrator-opus-4-8.md` |
| `gpt-5.6-sol` | `../multi-model/references/orchestrator-gpt-5-6-sol.md` |
| `gpt-5.6-terra` | `../multi-model/references/orchestrator-gpt-5-6-terra.md` |
| `gpt-5.6-luna` | `../multi-model/references/orchestrator-gpt-5-6-luna.md` |
| unknown | `../multi-model/references/orchestrator-generic.md` |

The alias `gpt-5.6` selects Sol only after the runtime-context handler has
normalized it to `gpt-5.6-sol`. An exact supplied effort may be used; otherwise
effort is unknown and receives no effort-specific claim. Always reply to the
user in the language the user writes in.

While authoring or amending a plan, the active profile chooses executor, supervisor, ladder, and effort. Never substitute unnamed host defaults. The profile also selects the plan host: each resulting wave is entirely Claude or entirely Codex across its supervisor, executors, and ladders.

## Process

1. **Research** to decomposition depth: files, dependencies, conventions,
   test commands that actually run. For a large surface, fan out read-only
   research agents routed by multi-model's Research Routing table
   (`../multi-model/SKILL.md`) — name a model on every spawn (an agent
   without one inherits the session's model, and a Fable seat (5 or 5.1) then pays
   Fable prices for file listings), and give each agent the table's
   mandatory research-prompt lines. Synthesis and every decision stay with
   you — do not delegate decisions, executors silently fill gaps under
   ambiguity.
2. **Decisions.** Everything derivable from the codebase you decide and
   record. Collect genuine product forks in one batch. Use the host-native structured input tool
   when it is available; otherwise ask one concise direct
   question and wait. In headless mode, record the unresolved choices under
   `Assumptions (would ask)` without silently deciding them.
3. **Gate 1 — design.** Present a compact summary: architecture, the wave
   sketch (which tasks, which waves, why), decisions taken, forks the user
   answered. One approval, then stop touching the design.
4. **Tasks.** Write them by multi-model's rules: closed (no "decide what's
   best"), self-contained (the executor sees nothing but its prompt), full
   code included where the solution is known. Each task carries the
   five-key contract; the active profile chooses every model, effort,
   supervisor, and ladder field, with the wave's supervisor chosen for the
   strongest executor in the wave. Group into waves by
   file-independence: same-wave tasks must not share files — merge
   colliding tasks or split them across consecutive waves. Dependent
   chains are consecutive waves, never one wave.

   **Right-size every task.** The measured lever for wave success is task
   breadth, not model choice: two broad tasks failed for 717 and 139
   minutes respectively and shipped only after being re-cut into five
   narrow tasks that each passed first-try in 5–95 minutes. Split signals —
   any one is enough: `files_allowed` spans more than one module or
   subsystem; the description carries more than ~3 distinct deliverables;
   the prose needs "and then" chains to say what done means. Prefer more,
   narrower tasks: one deliverable one executor can finish and one judge
   can check in a single session.

   **Scope each contract's gates to its files.** Derive `must_run` from
   `files_allowed`: a task confined to one module carries that module's
   check command, never the full-repo gate — the full gate runs once per
   wave at merge. Full-repo commands in per-task contracts multiply
   wall-clock by the task count for no added safety (measured: one session
   re-ran the identical full-monorepo gate 12 times).

   **Record the expected base status of every `must_run`.** For each
   command, state in the task prose whether it is green at base or
   expected-red because the task itself creates what it checks. Execution
   preflights every command at the base and compares against this
   expectation; a mismatch is a contract defect caught before any executor
   is spawned.
5. **Lint.** Run the shipped linter and fix every error yourself — the
   user never edits the plan. Lint runs before Gate 2. A mixed-provider wave is a planning defect to fix before Gate 2; never ask the linter or runner to guess a provider:

   ```
   node <this skill's base directory>/references/plan-lint.mjs <plan-file> --repo <repo>
   ```

   Warnings are judgment calls; errors are not negotiable. A plan that
   fails lint is not presented to the user.
6. **Gate 2 — plan.** Show the lint-clean plan file; one approval.
7. **Handoff.** "Execute with multi-model (supervised waves)." The plan
   file IS the wave-plan artifact: the json block feeds the runner directly —
   each runner task is the json entry plus its `## Task` prose as
   `description` (the runner rejects a task without one, by name). The
   `status:` field stays `draft` here — status transitions belong
   to execution (multi-model sets `active` at launch and
   `done` at completion), never to planning and never to the user.

## Plan Format

One file in `docs/superpowers/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<feature>.md`, three layers:

1. **Unfenced header** at column 0, before any code fence (the drift hook
   reads it there). The first two lines of the file are exactly these, as
   plain text — NOT inside a code fence, not indented, with nothing above
   them (no title, no prose):

   status: draft
   base: pending

   A title or any other markdown may follow the header, but never precede
   it, and the header itself must never be fenced — a fenced or indented
   header is invisible to the drift hook and fails lint.

2. **The machine half** — exactly one fenced block whose info string is
   `json wave-plan` (plain ```json fences inside task prose stay legal and
   are ignored by the linter):

   ```json wave-plan
   { "waves": [
     { "wave": 1,
       "supervisor": { "model": "opus", "effort": "high" },
       "tasks": [
         { "id": "http-retry",
           "branch": "wave/http-retry",
           "executor": { "model": "sonnet", "effort": "medium" },
           "ladder": ["opus"],
           "contract": {
             "files_allowed": ["src/http/**"],
             "files_forbidden": [],
             "must_run": [{ "cmd": "pytest tests/http -q", "evidence": "required" }],
             "forbidden_moves": ["weakening, deleting or skipping an existing test"],
             "report_must_answer": ["Which call sites now retry?"] } } ] }
   ] }
   ```

   The model fields use the active profile's plan host and this exact table:

   | Plan host | Allowed model fields |
   |---|---|
   | Claude | `haiku`, `sonnet`, `opus`, `fable`, `claude-opus-4-8` |
   | Codex | `gpt-5.6-sol`, `gpt-5.6-terra`, `gpt-5.6-luna` |

   `gpt-5.6` is never a plan id. It is only an active-session alias after
   runtime-context normalization, not a model field. Every supervisor,
   executor, and ladder entry in one wave uses the same row. A mixed-provider
   wave is a planning defect to fix before Gate 2, not a request for the
   linter or runner to guess a provider. `branch` is always `wave/<id>`. The
   supervisor sits on the wave because execution is one runner invocation per
   wave.

   The ladder lists model transitions only. For Codex, same-model raised-effort rework is state-machine behavior, so do not invent duplicate same-model ladder entries.

3. **The prose half** — one `## Task <id>` section per task: the
   substantive description and context, with full code where the solution
   is known. At launch, multi-model composes each runner task as the json
   entry plus its prose section, verbatim.

## Acceptance References

When the request carries product or visual references — Figma links,
screenshots, mockups, behavioral specs — the plan records them in a
dedicated `## Acceptance References` section: one entry per reference, its
source, and the concrete facts that must match (sizes, colors, copy, flow
order). Then convert everything statically checkable into contract pins: a
hex token, a dimension constant or a string of copy becomes a `must_run`
grep in the owning task's contract. What cannot be pinned statically —
animation feel, layout at runtime, end-to-end flow behavior — stays listed:
execution and review carry the unverified remainder into the PR body as an
explicit manual-QA list rather than letting it vanish. Measured cost of
skipping this: one contract-green feature needed ~18 hours of
after-the-fact manual QA for defects (wrong gradients, duplicated toolbars,
misplaced flows) that were all visible in references the plan never
recorded. No references given → no section: there is nothing to check
against.

## Headless evaluation mode

When there is no user to answer gates (an eval harness runs you), skip both
gates and record every fork you would have asked under a section titled
`## Assumptions (would ask)` in the plan file. Deciding a product fork
silently is the failure this mode exists to measure.

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Consequence | Correct |
|---|---|---|
| Two same-wave tasks sharing a file | Merge conflicts after isolation did its job | Merge the tasks or split the waves; lint enforces it |
| Dripping questions one at a time | The user becomes the bottleneck | Collect genuine forks in one batch with the host-native question behavior |
| Deciding a product fork silently | The most expensive wrong turn there is | Batch it to the user; in headless mode, record it |
| Presenting a plan that fails lint | The user debugs your format | Lint first, fix every error, then present |
| Setting `status: active` while planning | The drift hook pays for a wave that is not running | Leave `draft`; execution owns transitions |
| A task whose fix is "see the conversation" | The executor sees only its prompt | Self-contained tasks, full code where known |
| A task spanning several modules | Hours-long attempts, repeated rejects | Split by deliverable; narrow `files_allowed` |
| A full-repo gate in a per-task contract | Wall-clock multiplied by the task count | Scope `must_run` to the task's module |
| Visual references left out of the plan | Fidelity defects surface as post-ship manual QA | Record Acceptance References; pin what greps can pin |
