# Tier 2 — the invariants a skill's behaviour depends on.
#
# Honest about what this tier is: assertions over prose. It catches a rule being
# deleted or silently reworded, and it caught nothing in the 2026-08-11 review,
# where all three serious findings came from probing behaviour instead. So only
# load-bearing text lives here — a line whose loss changes what the agent DOES,
# or reopens a defect that has already cost us once. Wording that is merely nice
# is deliberately not pinned: a suite that fails on rephrasing gets neutered.
